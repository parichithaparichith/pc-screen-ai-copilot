## **How to Set Up and Run the Application**

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.11+**:
   - Make sure Python 3.11 or higher is installed on your system.
   - Check your Python version:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:
   - Sign up for an OpenAI API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).
   - Add your API key to the application:
     - Open the `settings.ini` file in the project directory.
     - Add your OpenAI API key:
       ```
       OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
       ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the application:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - The application will run on `http://localhost:8888`.

### **Run application in the Background**

#### **Linux/Mac**:
- Use `nohup` to run the Flask application in the background and keep it running even after closing the terminal:
  ```bash
  nohup python3 main.py &
  ```
  - The `&` symbol runs the process in the background.
  - Output logs will be saved in the `nohup.out` file by default.

- Alternatively, use a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` or `screen` to manage the process:
  ```bash
  tmux new -s flask_session
  python3 main.py
  ```
  - Detach from the session using `Ctrl+B D` (for `tmux`) or `Ctrl+A D` (for `screen`).
  - Reattach later with `tmux attach -t flask_session`.

- To stop the background process:
  - Find the process ID (PID) using:
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep python
    ```
  - Kill the process using:
    ```bash
    kill <PID>
    ```

---

#### **Windows**:
- Use `pythonw.exe` to run the Flask application in the background without a terminal window:
  ```cmd
  pythonw.exe main.py
  ```
  - This will run the script in the background, and no terminal window will appear.

- To stop the background process:
  - Open **Task Manager**.
  - Locate the `pythonw.exe` process under the **Background Processes** section.
  - Right-click and select **End Task**.
